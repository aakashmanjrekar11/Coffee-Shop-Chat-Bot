# â˜• Coffee-Shop-Chat-Bot
- Our project is based on Starbucks Chatbot in which we present a real-world conversational AI system to help customers order coffee and snacks from the Starbucks store by chatting with our Starbucks Chatbot. 
- Our architecture consists of a frame-based dialogue management system, which calls machine learning models for intent classification, named entity recognition, and information retrieval subtasks.
